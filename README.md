# Simply-Succulents
A Succulent Store
<br>
Chester County High School / Ethan Mullins, Heather Mcmahan
<br><br>
Ethan: All HTML, CSS, and PHP, picked products.<br>I want to go to college for this exact stuff, I've fallen in love with HTML, PHP, and CSS in the years I have done it, I love the problem solving involved in making a mock website (tho frustrating sometimes)
<br><br>
Heather: Color Scheme, Merch, picked products, logo, website design.<br>I want to go to college for some type of design and this website gave me great experience in the collaboration aspects of design.
<br><br>
I believe we went above and beyond on the extras page with our own homeade merch and making the website responsive for mobile. Also a small detail I thought was really cool was using PHP to automatically change my class for CSS on the rating in my reviews page.
<br><br>
Some of the main problems we had to overcome were getting the final price displayed on the cart and also figuring out how to display different groups of products in different sections like we did in the seperate sections of the extras page.
<br><br>
We custom made all of the logos merch, supplies and altered some of the images to obtain a white background.
